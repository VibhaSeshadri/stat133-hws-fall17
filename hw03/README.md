HW03 - Ranking NBA Teams

The purpose of this HW is to continue working with data frames, produce plots, work with a complex file structure, and get an introduction to PCA.

Some links to websites I used when stuck on a problem:

How to describe PCs: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/102658/why-does-pca-maximize-total-variance-of-the-projection

What a PC is: https://georgemdallas.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/principal-component-analysis-4-dummies-eigenvectors-eigenvalues-and-dimension-reduction/

How to create Horizontal barcharts: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10941225/horizontal-barplot-in-ggplot2

How to calculate the cumulative proportions without hardcoding: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23866765/getting-cumulative-proportion-in-pca

I also used the ggplot2 cheat sheet for help when creating ggplots

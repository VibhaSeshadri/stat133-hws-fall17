**Some links to websites I used when stuck on a problem:**

* Rounding:

* How cex should be used

For the problem I had with `abline()` I figured out after looking through my code and realizing that my y-axis scale was different than the scale `b0` and `b1` were calculated with.

* Y-hat:
I found the latex way to do this, but I couldnâ€™t find a way to make it show up in the markdown file, so I just found the y hat symbol online and just copied and pasted the character into my Rmd file

**References:**
I used the `?` and `??` commands in the R console when I needed a more comprehensive explanation for what a function did. I also went to office hours when I was confused about something, and the `?` and `??` commands as well as any webpages I found were not enough for me to understand the concept. Examples of functions I used the help function with in the R Console: `abline()`, `lowess()`, `scatterplot3D()`, `boxplot()`, `text()`, `lines()`

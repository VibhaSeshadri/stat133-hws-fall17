#### Introduction

*Data Manipulation*. *Data Analytics*. *Data _____ *. Let's just say *data* is a huge buzzword these days. But data is more than just a buzzword. As more and more companies and organizations focus on data collection, manipulation, and analysis, more people are learning how to use different Data related tools. I am currently in a STAT133, a course here at UC Berkeley which focuses on Concepts in Computing with Data. A few weeks ago, we learned about a handy package in R created by Hadley Wickham called `dplyr`. `Dyplr` provides functions which one can use in replacement of base R indexing and subsetting when analyzing and manipulating data frames. The best part is that `Dyplr` is easy to use, easy to learn, and extremely powerful! But when should one use `dyplr` as opposed to a querying language such as `SQL` when working with data? This post aims to explore the pros and cons of both `dyplr` and `SQL`, explain when one should be used instead of the other, and highlight situations in which both could be used.

# HW02 - Basics of Data Frames
The purpose of this HW is to start working with data frames.

For this homework, I did not use Google or Stack Overflow as much because many of the questions and confusions I had were answered just be looking at our past labs.

Labs homeworks, and commands I referenced, and why:

- lab05 for `dplyr` syntax and `ggplot2` syntax and functions
- up02 for making bar chart bar labels fit and appear on the screen
- `??cor` to see what arguments the function took
- Lecture Slides from the lecture on importing data to figure out how to use `read.csv()` and `read_csv()` in practice

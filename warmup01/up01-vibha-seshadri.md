Pani Puri Recipe
================

#### An Indian Chaat Dish

> I've always believed that Pani Puri isn't just a good dish, because it's a ***great*** dish

**Ingredients Needed**

-   Pre-made Puri (Fried Pastry Balls)
-   Water
-   Tamarind Paste
-   Chilli Powder
-   Masala Powder
-   Onion
-   Potatoes\*
-   Cilantro
-   Sev (Thin, long fried strands of gram flour)

**List of Tools Needed**

-   Deep bowl or pitcher to create the Pani (Water + Tamarind Paste + Spices)
-   Plate to put all the puris on
-   Seperate bowls to place the Onions, Potatoes, Sev and Cilantro in individually
-   Teaspoons for each bowl
-   Large spoon to serve the Pani
-   Small bowls for people to use when eating the pani puri

**The following directions on how to create the dish assumes one has bought pre-made puris and is only using pani as opposed to spicy pani and sweet sauce**

1.  Fill the bowl or pitcher with water
2.  Add the tamarind paste and spices to the water
3.  Mix the paste and spices in the water until the color is rich and even
4.  Cut the onion into very small square pieces, and place them in one bowl
5.  Peel and mash the potatoes\*\*
6.  Sprinkle chilli and chaat powder over the potatoes. Place the mashed potatoes into another bowl
7.  Wash the cilantro and place into another bowl
8.  Place the sev in the last and smallest bowl
9.  When ready to eat, poke a large hole on one side of the Puri, and fill it with potatoes, onions, cilantro, and the sev.
10. Fill the filled in puri 3/4ths of the way with the Pani
11. Eat the whole thing in one bite or risk all the stuffing in the Puri from falling out!

There is no need to wait for a special occasion to eat these mouth watering treats! The beauty of Pani Puri is that it's **easy to make**, **bite sized**, and **fun to eat with friends and family**. In fact, in India, there are many street side carts that sell these snacks one puri at a time to hungry customers. Pani Puri is a year round favorite!

\* *To make the Pani Puri healthier and less filling, you can substitute the potatoes for garbanzo beans.
\*\* In the recipe, steps 5 and 6 would be combined into one step which involves pouring the garbanzo beans from their can into a bowl.*

Quadratic Equation
==================

#### A simple equation with a lot of utility

You can use the quadratic equation to solve for the unknown, **x**. The quadratic equation can only be used with a polynomial equation where the highest power is **2**. To learn more about the quadratic equation, read this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation).

**General Quadratic Equation**
*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
 **General Forumula for Roots of the Quadratic Equation**
$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**Discriminant**

> When *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c* is ...

|      &lt; 0     |    &gt; 0    |     = 0     |

Comments and Reflections
========================

#### How I completed this assignment

The most useful resource I used for this assignment was the [Common Mardown tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/). It provided simple guidance, explanation, and practice to understand what I had to do to diversify my text and include links for images and text. Besides this tutorial, I found much of the answers I was looking for just by Googling my question. The most common resources I used were Quora and Stack Overflow. The hardest part of this homework was figuring out how to include the ±, $\\sqrt{}$, and $\\frac{numerator}{denominator}$ in my quadratic equation. I figured it out by Googling questions such as "How to write root sign in LaTex." Since I had already used markdown during lab on Friday, this assignment wasn't too difficult, but it definitely reinforced what I learned while completing the lab. Also, I have worked with languages such as HTML before, so markdown was not too difficult to understand, but I really like the simplicity and power of markdown!
